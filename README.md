# Tail-Risk Forecasting  

Forecasting extreme market risk using **GARCH** and **Neural Networks**, comparing Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for the **S&P 500** and **VIX**.

---

## Overview  
This project explores how deep learning compares to traditional models in forecasting extreme market volatility.
The dataset covers 2000–2025, sourced from the Yahoo Finance API using historical data for the S&P 500 and the VIX index.

---

## Methods  
- **Econometric:** GARCH(1,1), Historical Simulation, Variance–Covariance  
- **Deep Learning:** Feed-forward Neural Networks for volatility and tail-risk forecasting 
- **Evaluation:** VaR coverage, Expected Shortfall accuracy, and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
